IRIS FlowerClassification using Machine Learning
Project Overview:This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on four features:
Sepal Length,Sepal Width,Petal Length,Petal Width
The classification model is built using Python in Jupyter Notebook with the Iris dataset.
Technologies Used:Python,Jupyter Notebook,Pandas,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib,Seaborn
Dataset:iris.csv from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (also comes with scikit-learn)
Contains 150 rows and 5 columns (4 features + species)
Model Used:Logistic Regression (or you can mention KNN, SVM, etc. if you used them)
Achieved high accuracy in classifying flower types
Results:Data was visualized using Seaborn pairplots
The model was trained, tested, and evaluated with high accuracy
Confusion matrix and accuracy score were used for evaluation
